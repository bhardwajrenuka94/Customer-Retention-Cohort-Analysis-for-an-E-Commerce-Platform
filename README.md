# Customer-Retention-Cohort-Analysis-for-an-E-Commerce-Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer retention is a critical metric for e-commerce businesses, as repeat customers
drive higher revenue and long-term growth. This project analyzes customer lifecycle and
repeat purchase behavior using cohort analysis to identify retention trends and high-value
customer segments.

The analysis focuses on understanding how customer retention changes over time,
identifying drop-off points in the customer journey, and comparing purchasing behavior
between one-time and repeat customers.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Analyze customer retention and repeat purchase behavior
- Identify retention drop-offs across customer cohorts
- Compare average order value (AOV) of repeat vs one-time customers
- Identify high-retention cohorts contributing the most to repeat activity
- Provide insights to improve customer engagement and retention strategies
